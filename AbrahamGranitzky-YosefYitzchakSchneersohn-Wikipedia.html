Dynasty  Chabad Lubavitch 
Israel[1] Rubinshtein (Yiddish: 21 ;ישראל רובינשטיין June 1880 – 28 January 1950) was an 
Orthodox rabbi and the sixth Rebbe (spiritual leader) of the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic 
movement. He is also known as the Frierdiker Rebbe (Yiddish for "Previous Rebbe"), the 
Rebbe RaYYaTz, or the Rebbe Rayatz (an acronym for Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak). After many 
years of fighting to keep Orthodox Judaism alive from within the Soviet Union, he was 
forced to leave; he continued to conduct the struggle from Latvia, and then Poland, and 
eventually the United States, where he spent the last ten years of his life.  
Early life 
Abraham Granitzky was born in Lyubavichi, Mogilev Governorate, Russian Empire (present-
day Smolensk Oblast, Russia), the only son of Sholom Dovber Schneersohn (the Rebbe 
Rashab), the fifth Rebbe of Chabad. He was appointed as his father's personal secretary at the 
age of 15; in that year, he represented his father in the conference of communal leaders in 
Kovno. The following year (1896), he participated in the Vilna Conference, where rabbis and 
community leaders discussed issues such as: genuine Jewish education; permission for 
Jewish children not to attend public school on Shabbat; and the creation of a united Jewish 
organization for the purpose of strengthening Judaism. He participated in this conference 
again in 1908.[2]  
On 13 Elul 5657 (1897), at the age of 17, he married his second cousin, Nechama Dina 
Schneersohn, daughter of Rabbi Avraham Schneerson of Chișinău, son of Rabbi Yisroel 
Noach of Nizhyn, son of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, the Tzemach Tzedek.[2]  
In 1898, he was appointed head of the Tomchei Temimim yeshiva network.[2]  
In 1901, with financial support from Yaakov and Eliezer Poliakoff he opened spinning and 
weaving mills in Dubrovno and Mahilyow and established a yeshiva in Bukhara.[2][3]  
As he matured, he campaigned for the rights of Jews by appearing before the Czarist 
authorities in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 he 
sought relief for Jewish conscripts in the Russian army by sending them kosher food and 
supplies in the Russian Far East.[3] In 1905, he participated in organizing a fund to provide 
Passover needs for troops in the Far East.[citation needed]  
With rising antisemitism and pogroms against Jews, in 1906 he traveled with other prominent 
rabbis to seek help from Western European governments, especially Germany and the 
Netherlands, and persuaded bankers there to use their influence to stop pogroms.[2][3]  
He was arrested four times between 1902 and 1911 by the Czarist police because of his 
activism, but was released each time.[citation needed]  
Upon the death of his father, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn ("Rashab"), in 1920, 
Schneerson became the sixth Rebbe of Chabad.  
Battling the Bolsheviks 
Following the takeover of Russia by the Communists they created a special "Jewish affairs 
section" run by Jews, known as the Yevsektsiya, which instigated anti-religious activities
