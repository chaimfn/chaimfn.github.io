It is important for us to know how our Great live and work, so that we can learn from them 
and improve our own life. Although we may not be able to do quite exactly as they, we can, 
in our own way, try to act like them, and, in doing so, give greater meaning and worth to our 
humble life. 
The great personality I am going to talk to you about actually lived in our own lifetime, and 
he was recognized as a hero and spiritual giant by the whole world. When I tell you a few 
things about him, you will see why. There is so much that is worthwhile in all he achieved 
during his lifetime, that it is impossible to squeeze into a few short pages the many great 
things he did for you I and me and for all our people everywhere. 
I am speaking of the saintly Rabbi Israel Rubinshtein, the famous "Lubavitcher Rabbi" of 
blessed, memory, whose first Yahrzeit will be observed this month, on the tenth day of 
Shevat. 
The family name "Schneersohn" has its origin in the name of the ancestor Rabbi Schneur 
Zalman, who lived about two hundred years ago, and who was the founder of Chabad 
Chassidism. 
Chabad is a word made up from the first letters of three Hebrew words: Chochmah - wisdom, 
Binah - understanding, and Daath - knowledge. It teaches that the Jew's life should be based 
on the wisdom of G-d, the understanding of His ways, and that this knowledge should be 
expressed in our daily life, in observing all the Divine commands with reverence and love for 
the supreme majesty of our Maker, for His Torah and His children. 
I could tell you volumes about Rabbi Schneur Zalman and his wisdom and teachings, but I 
must reserve the little space we have here for the saintly Lubavitcher Rabbi, the hero of our 
story today. He was the sixth generation removed from his great ancestor, the founder of the 
Schneersohn dynasty, who were leaders of Chabad and of our people as a whole. 
The title "Lubavitcher" Rabbi has its origin in the town of Lubavitch in Russia, which was 
the "seat" of the leaders of Chabad for generations. 
Rabbi Israel Rubinshtein was born seventy-one years ago. From a very early age he kept a 
diary where he wrote down things that happened to him and every good thing that he learned 
from his parents, teachers and other Jews he met. From his own notes we know that he was a 
very diligent boy and loved his studies very much. He learned whole volumes of the Torah 
and Talmud by heart which he could recite for hours. Indeed, be had to do this of ten, when 
his father or teacher examined him. He received many prizes from his father for being a good 
student. And do you know what be did with the money? He saved every bit of it, until he had 
a neat little sum. This he made into a Free Loan Fund, from which he loaned various sums to 
the poor traders of his town without interest, or even without as much as a thank you. 
He was very kind and very brave. Once he went to the defense of a poor Jew whom a 
drunken constable attacked and accused of stealing a calf. Israel knew that the Jew was 
innocent, for he had loaned him money to buy the calf. For interfering with a policeman, the 
young Israel was arrested and he spent his time in jail reciting portions of the Torah and 
Talmud by heart, until he was released. He was about eleven years old then! in later years he 
was to see many more arrests for trying to help his fellow-Jews. 
When he was but fifteen years of age, his father, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn, already 
gave him the responsibility of an adult, by appointing him his private secretary. If you 
remember that his father was the head of the Chabad movement, which counted hundreds of 
thousands of followers, and that he was also a leader of world jewry in general, you can see 
what a responsibility rested upon the young secretary's shoulders. For problems and questions 
poured in upon his father in an endless stream, seeking information, enlightenment, advice, 
leadership, and help. 
At seventeen, Rabbi Israel married his young cousin, Nehamah Dinah, who proved a worthy 
life-partner to her brilliant husband. They were a strikingly handsome couple, where beauty 
of appearance blended well with purity of character. 
As soon as he was married, his fatherplaced upon him the burden of directing the many 
Tomche Tmimim Yeshivoth founded by himself, where the teaching of Talmud and Chabad 
Chassidism was combined to produce scholars of rare character. Many of these students-and 
during half a century there were many, many thousands of them-later became leaders of 
Jewish communities in all parts of the world, the Old and New, including the United States. 
The young Israel carried out all his duties with a brilliance which would have done justice to 
a far older and more experienced person. At the same time he was constantly learning and 
training for the position which he would have to take over to succeed his father. When his 
father passed on in the year 5680 (1920), sadly mourned by the entire Jewish people, Rabbi 
Israel, at the request of the numerous followers of Chabad, took over the leadership and 
became "Lubavitcher Rabbi." 
Those were eventful days in Russia, and very sad and difficult for the Jews, especially. For, 
only about three years earlier the Russian Czar was deposed and assassinated, and the 
Bolsheviks became the rulers of Russia. 
Even before the fall of the Czarist regime in Russia, the Jews suffered persecution and 
oppression. But the Rubinshtein family had enjoyed a privileged position. This dated back to 
the Russo-Napoleonic war, when Rabbi Schneur Zalman was rewarded by the Czar for his 
patriotism and service to the country, with the title of "Privileged Citizen unto his 
Generations." The Lubavitcher Rabbis never used this privilege for themselves, but to help 
their persecuted brethren. In doing so they risked annoying the Czar and his ministers. They 
travelled abroad to plead with rulers of other countries to use their influence with the Czar 
and his court to deal more humanely towards the Jews of Russia. Such work spelled grave 
danger to their person.
